octave (4.0.0~rc3-1) experimental; urgency=low

  A graphical user interface is now the default when running Octave
  interactively.  The start-up option --no-gui will run the familiar
  command line interface, and still allows use of the GUI dialogs and
  qt plotting toolkit.  The option --no-gui-libs runs a minimalist
  command line interface that does not link with the Qt libraries and
  uses the fltk toolkit for plotting.

  Starting with this release, the Octave add-ons packaged in Debian will
  no longer autoload by default. You may need to adapt existing scripts,
  by adding "pkg load <package>" statements.

octave (3.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The just-it-time (JIT) compiler has been disabled in this version,
  because it creates problems with the Gallium llvmpipe Mesa driver.
  Since the JIT is currently very basic, it is not worth the trouble. It
  may be re-enabled later when the benefits outweigh the costs. See
  #743260 for more details.

octave (3.8.0~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Starting with this version, the octave package now contains an
  experimental graphical user interface (GUI) based on the Qt toolkit.
  That GUI can be started by giving the `--force-gui' option to the
  octave binary.

  For those who want to keep the lower memory footprint of a pure text
  interface, there is the `octave-cli' executable which is not linked
  against Qt.

  Starting with this version, Octave incorporates a just-in-time (JIT)
  compiler, which can offer performance improvements in some situations.
  Since it is still experimental, the JIT is disabled by default, but
  you can activate it with the `jit_enable' command.
